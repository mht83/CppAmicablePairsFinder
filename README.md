# C++ Amicable Pairs Finder

## Introduction
The C++ Amicable Pairs Finder is a command-line application designed to identify amicable pairs within a specified range. Amicable pairs are two numbers where the sum of the proper divisors of each number equals the other number.

## Features
- Efficient calculation of sum of divisors
- Identification of amicable pairs up to 1,000,000
- Beautiful CLI with colored output

## Beautiful CLI
The C++ Amicable Pairs Finder features a **beautiful command-line interface (CLI)** that enhances user interaction and experience. With color-coded output and clear formatting, users can easily navigate through the results and enjoy a visually appealing display of amicable pairs.

### CLI Features
- **Color-Coded Output**: Utilizes ANSI color codes to differentiate between various types of output, making it easier to read and understand.
- **Structured Format**: Outputs are organized in a structured format with proper spacing and alignment for better readability.
- **Interactive Experience**: Although primarily output-based, the application provides a smooth and user-friendly experience on the command line.

To experience the full beauty of the CLI, ensure your terminal supports ANSI color codes and is capable of displaying colors.
